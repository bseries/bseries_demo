# Bâ€“Series Web Application Distribution

## Abstract

The B-Series distribution is an application system that includes the overarching directory layout, an example starting application, and very useful tools to manage the lifecycle of a software project.

The distribution is the basis for your own project and the starting point for anyone interested in the B-Series.

## Initializing

All future commands are executed from the root of the project. Let's begin with switching to it first.
```
$ git clone git@github.com:BSeries/distro.git project
$ cd project
```

The following command will initialize the project by filling certain placeholder in the configuration files, so you don't have to.
```
$ make init
```

The `Envfile` is a per environment configuration file, holding the main configuration (i.e. database settings). Modify it:
```
$ vim Envfile
```

... as well as the host configuration file, if you plan to use [Hoi](https://github.com/atelierdisko/hoi):
```
$ vim Hoifile
```

If you already know which application libraries you'd like to use (or not to), edit the `app/composer.json` file and make changes.
```
$ vim app/composer.json
```

Then initially install the dependencies using the following command. App dependencies are managed by Composer.
```
$ make install-deps
```

Some B-modules contain an `assets` directory, which needs to be symlinked into the project's assets directory, so files in there can be accessed by the webserver.
```
$ bin/link-assets.sh
```

Continue to initialize the database using the following command, and create the initial users.
```
$ bin/init-db.sh
$ bin/li3.php users initial
```

## Serving the Project

Atelier Disko projects are usually served by Hoi, which
takes care of any needs the project has.
```
$ hoictl load
```

Sometimes Hoi isn't available inside the target environment.
You will than have to take care of configuring webserver,
database, cronjobs and workers yourself.

## Side-Autoloading of JavaScript Assets

For autoloading of JavaScript it is important, that
files are named using camelCase:

BAD:
  - `assets/js/foo-bar.js`
  - `assets/js/foo.bar.js`

GOOD:
  - `assets/js/fooBar.js`

The following JavaScript scripts will always be loaded and bootstrap the application's JavaScript, thus must always be present:

  - `assets/js/require.js`
  - `assets/js/base.js`

Often you've got JavaScript that is specific to a single view and action. Place files using the following path schema to autoload them once a view is requested. When using AMD in these files they must use `require()` instead of `define()``.

  - `assets/js/views/layouts/<layout>.js`
  - `assets/js/views/<controller>/<action>.js`

Such an autoloadable files would look like this:
```javascript
require(['jquery', 'domready!'], function($) {
  // ...
});
```

## Side-Autoloading of CSS Assets

Autoloading of CSS files is very similar to autoloading of JavaScript files. These Stylesheets are always loaded and must be present:

  - `assets/css/base.css`

View specific CSS can be placed into the "views" subdirectory structure similar as described for JavaScript above.

  - `assets/css/views/layouts/<layout>.css`
  - `assets/css/views/<controller>/<action>.css`

All `views` CSS files, except those in `elements`, are loaded automatically when needed. However, its good practice to
scope them to their page (here: `views/pages/home.css`):

```css
.home .banner {
	/* ... */
}
```

## Special Layout Functions

```php
$this->set([
	'extraBodyClasses' => ['has-foo', 'more-bar']
]);
```

## B-Series Modules and other App Libraries

This distribution comes bundled at a minimum with two modules already: `base_core`, for providing the admin and core functionality as well as features that other modules depend on; `base_media` for providing management, upload of media files.

Additional modules can be added by making them additional dependencies:

```
$ composer -d app require bseries/cms_social
```

## Running Tasks

The distribution comes with some useful tasks that help with setting up the application and reaching as far as deploying the whole project. The tasks are implemented using GNU Make inside the Makefile.

```
$ make fix-perms
```

## Running Framework Commands

The lithium framework supports its own set of commands[1], which we use specifically inside some modules (i.e. base_core/extensions/commands) to run certain tasks that need access to the database or the application itself.

In order to run such commands execute the following:

```
$ bin/li3.php
$ bin/li3.php help
$ bin/li3.php jobs
```

## Deploying

```
$ vim Deployfile
```

```
$ bin/deploy.sh
```

## SSL Certificates

The config/ssl directory contains all files related to SSL. The name of the domain (FQDN) is always taken from the file names (i.e. example.com.key).

In the first step you must generate the signing request. A signing key is automatically generated when needed.
```
$ make config/ssl/example.com.csr
```

Once you receive the signed certificate it should be saved under
`config/ssl/example.com.crt`.

## Globalization

The translation workflow is based on GNU gettext.

To generate the initial or update existing translation files run the following command. This example uses English (`en`) as the target locale. To use different locales simply exchange `en` in the example for the target locale you desire...

```
$ make app/resources/g11n/po/en/LC_MESSAGES/default.po
```

Missing translations can then be filled in using your favorite application, i.e. [POEdit](https://poedit.net/).
