# Bâ€“Series Web Application Distribution

The B-Series distribution is an application system that includes the overarching directory layout, an example starting application, and very useful tools to manage the lifecycle of a software project.

The distribution is the basis for your own project and the starting point for anyone interested in the B-Series.
